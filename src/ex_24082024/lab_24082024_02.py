# Note:
# What can be the function name?
# 1)	It is not possible to create function name with numeric.
# 2)	We can create a function with name of underscore _
# 3)	We can create a function with name of a person.

#Example:
def 123():
    pass
#It is not possible to create function name with numeric.
# Here this new* is telling you that it is a new function. You can avoid it.

#Example:
def _():
    print("Hello")
#We can create a function with name of underscore _


#Example:
def mudit123():
    print("Hello")
#We can create a function with name of a person.


#Example:
def muditGupta();
    print("Hello Mudit")
#Python will give you error like "function name should be in lower case".


#Example:
def mudit_gupta():
    print("Hello mudit")
# If you want to use space then use underscore in python!!
