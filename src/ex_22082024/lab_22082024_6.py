#Example:

for i in range(10):
    if i ==5:
        print(i)
    else:
        pass

# As i ==5 then It will print 5 and for rest it will not print anything.

#Example:
# Run a programme of even number
# Run a programme of number divisable by 2 !!
for i in range(10):
    if i%2 == 0:
        print(i)
    else:
        pass
